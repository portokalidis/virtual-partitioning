Introduction: Virtual Partitioning - Data leakages protection 
============

This tool demonstrate the ability to monitor particular files, when accessed, relying on libdft library 
to prevent data leakages. 
 


Prerequisite 
============

This tool relies on Pin (http://www.pintool.org). 
Before install this tool you should install Pin.


Installation  
============


  1. Extract the latest Pin build. Assuming that it was extracted in
     `/usr/src/pin', we shall refer to that path as Pin's root path
      from now on

  2. Type `export PIN_HOME=/usr/src/pin' to set the environment
     variable PIN_HOME to the root path of Pin. Replace `/usr/src/pin'
     with *your* root path
  
  3. `cd' to the directory src/partitioned_dta, which contains the source code of
      virtual partitioning for preventing data leakages, and type `make'

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files by typing `make
     clean' on the directory src/partitioned_dta
 

Run: Virtual Partitioning - Data leakages protection 
============

  1. To run the data leakages protection module you should execute the following command: 
	`pin -mt -follow_execv -t <path-of
	data-leakage-protection/partitioned_dta.so> -fslist <file-includes-the-sensitive-files> -- <appliation-to-protect> `
  2. For the structure of file include the sensitive files please refer to "tracklist.conf"
